# Blockchain based Electronic Voting System


**Abstract**

With an emergence of distributed ledgertechnology, decentralization and integrity ininformation storage offer an opportunity to preservedata in electronic voting systems. An inevitablechallenge in e-voting system implementation is thetradeoff between system security and generality indesign. Leveraging container technology along withblockchain technology, this paper proposes a systemdesign architecture to deliver data security and agilitin system integration. The design was further analyzedand assessed by measuring the utilization of computingresources and conducting performance test as tovalidate that the aforementioned requirements weremet..

**In this project we will be aiming to address the following:-**

 - Trust based election voting system


****A platform to convert the MAPL to High Level Language** 

## Problem solved

 - Allow non technical competent to get production ready code.

  

## How it works

* It allows applications to consistently operate regardless of the environment or operating system.

* Two main Linux Kernel features that allowed the emergence of this technology are:
* Cgroups, namespaces



### Architecture

## Technologies Used

Auto-generation programming Tool uses a number of technologies to work properly:

* [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) - serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events.
* [Amazon S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web services.
* [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) -Amazon Polly is a cloud service by Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, that converts text into lifelike speech
* [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) -Representational state transfer is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style
* [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types
* [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/)- service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text

## WoW factor

Currently we spend too much effort writing the code from scratch. Our solution will facilitate the approach of problem solving with most of the code generated in a very user friendly and simple approach. It may also revolutionize the future Innovate48 events letting the non-technical folks to be a part of this event by using the solution we propose.
